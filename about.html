                        <p>

                            With a dynamic journey spanning multiple roles, I've honed my skills and expertise in
                            diverse engineering domains. Beginning as a Hardware Design Engineer at EInfochips Pvt Ltd,
                            I specialized in PCB design, power management circuits, and communication protocols under
                            Arrow Electronics. Transitioning to Scientech Technologies Pvt. Ltd. as a Research and
                            Development Engineer, I contributed to projects spanning educational training kits, smart
                            energy metering, and IoT solutions, refining my ability to tackle complex challenges.
                            Currently serving as a Junior Engineer at IITI DRISHTI CPS Foundation, I'm at the forefront
                            of technological innovation, spearheading projects like the "Digital Health Kiosk,"
                            integrating computer vision and precision sensors to streamline patient registration.
                            Additionally, I lead initiatives in digital twin development for critical care equipment,
                            collaborating with esteemed institutions like AIIMS, New Delhi, and Cambridge University,
                            UK. Passionate about mentoring researchers and advancing AI, ML, and embedded systems, I'm
                            committed to delivering affordable technical solutions for end consumers.

                        <h2>A Few More Words About Myself</h2>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I am deeply involved in social activities, dedicating my energy to
                            volunteering for national human rights organizations and Samadhan Society. These endeavors
                            allow me to contribute positively to society while also broadening my perspective on various
                            social issues.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, when I'm not immersed in engineering projects, I find solace
                            and inspiration in my hobbies. Photography, with its ability to capture fleeting moments and
                            unique perspectives, serves as a creative outlet for me, allowing me to express myself
                            artistically. Similarly, delving into science fiction literature fuels my imagination and
                            creativity, providing a much-needed escape from the rigors of my profession. Moreover, I
                            have a profound appreciation for traveling, as it affords me the opportunity to immerse
                            myself in diverse cultures and gain invaluable insights into different ways of life.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In summary, my life is a dynamic blend of professional pursuits, social engagement, and
                            personal interests, all of which contribute to my holistic approach to engineering and
                            innovation.
